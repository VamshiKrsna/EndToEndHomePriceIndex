# EndToEndHomePriceIndex
This is an End to End MLOps, MLFlow Integrated implementation of my previous app Home Price Index Predictor. It leverages the FRED API to extract key indicators that impact US Home Prices and trains several Regression Models like the Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest etc. Chooses the best model based on accuracy and deploys it to a streamlit app.
